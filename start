# This script is meant to be the entry point to any other script in the suite
# It does a lot of important things, one of them being resolving paths and exposing them as variables to the other scripts
# This way we avoid having to copy the import statement every time we want to make a new script
# We also source all the util functions and export them so they're available to the other scripts without them having to import util in each one

# If we get passed an argument we assume it's the program to run, we run it and exit
# If we don't get an argument we continue to the interactive
